# Clock-with-Alarm
Verilog code for a digital clock with an alarm feature. This project includes a clock module that counts hours, minutes, and seconds, and an alarm module that triggers an output signal at a specified time. The design supports 24-hour format and allows setting and resetting the alarm for precise timekeeping and alerts.
